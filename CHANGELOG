## [Unreleased]

## [4.4.285-cip63-rt36-moxa22] - 2022-07-06
### Fixed
* Un-revert bus-width and clock rate configuration on i.MX7 platform, because
  the emmc host is more stable at HS200 speed.

## [4.4.285-cip63-rt36-moxa21] - 2022-06-06
### Fixed
* Do not use CMD13 to get status after speed mode switch, duo to CMD13
  cannot be guaranteed due to the asynchronous operation.
* Revert bus-width and clock rate configuration on i.MX7 platform, because
  it looks not work on some devices.

## [4.4.285-cip63-rt36-moxa20] - 2022-05-25
### Fixed
* Configure bus-width as 4 bits and adjust the clock rate to HS200 to
  avoid usdhc host tuning issue on i.mx7d platform.

## [4.4.285-cip63-rt36-moxa19] - 2022-05-11

### Added
* Add HD44780 Character LCD driver for ls102xa because of it required by
  DA-662C series device.
* Add Character LCD driver for ls102xa because of it required by DA-662C
  series device.
* Add auxdisplay and keypad node to DA-662C device tree.

## [4.4.285-cip63-rt36-moxa17] - 2022-04-26
### Added
* Add UC-3111-LX-NW device tree file and update UC-3100 series its
  configuration to support UC-3111-LX-NW model.
